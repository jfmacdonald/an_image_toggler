# An Image Toggler

A Drupal 8 module that builds a component with two images, some text, and a button. 
If JavaScript is enabled, the second image is initially hidden, and pressing the button toggles which image is hidden. 

# Spec

Need a page with:

- an image
- some body copy
- another image
- a button

In the initial state, the first image is shown and the second hidden. When the button is activated, the displayed image is hidden and the hidden image is displayed. Subsequent button activations simply toggle the state.

No styling is needed but the markup should have classes ready for styling.
